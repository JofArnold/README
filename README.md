# About

Hello, I'm Jof.

I'm an engineering manager and software engineer specializing in React Native.

I've been coding since the '90s, full time since '06, React since 2013, React Native since 2017.

Most of my spare time is spent on blockchain dev specialising in zero knowledge proofs - with a particular interest in the economic systems that ZKPs can enable - but I also sculpt in wood from time to time.

I have a slightly strange history involving nuclear reactor inspection robots, Russian space craft, motorsport, fuel injection systems and a couple of startups. You can find out more on my site below.
